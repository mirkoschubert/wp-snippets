  To localize Google Fonts use the Google Webfonts Helper (https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) and download all fonts you use in the fonts directory. Then place any font-face entry in this css file.

  Please note, that more than two fonts wouldn't be a very good design choice and will decrease the performance of the site!
