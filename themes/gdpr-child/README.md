# GDPR Child Theme

### Instructions

* In order to create your own child theme with this boilerplate, you have to replace all `gdpr` strings with the name of your parent theme and edit the data in the `style.css` as well. If you want to append your own CSS code, you should use the `.child` class as a prefix.
* Please note, that this Child Theme is **not** fully functional! If you want to use it, you have to determine whether the parent theme uses `function_exists()` calls or not and change the `functions.php` accordingly.
* To use the `TODO` file you should edit it with VSCode and the `Todo+` extension. Please read their documentation.
