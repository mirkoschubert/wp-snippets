# WordPress Snippets

This repository contains some snippets for WordPress development which I use frequently. There are security features for the `.htaccess` and `wp-config.php` and some child themes and boilerplates.

In the future I will add more and more new snippets and some docs for best practice plugins etc. If you like, you can add some snippets as well. Please fork the project and send pull requests!
